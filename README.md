# FSM-Equation

## Description
 A finite state machine (FSM) that performs an arithmetic computation of the form (x·a + y·b), where x and y are two 8 bit given numbers from switches, a and b are two constants hardcoded as sums of powers of two, and the result is provided through the 16 leds on the board.
